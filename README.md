"I'm Pedro Lustosa, and I am gradually getting deeper into the area of software development"

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 
In these last days I am improving my knowledge in the Laravel Framework, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Vue.js, JavaScript and a little flutter for mobile. But, after this phase I will learn more about React, Angular and Java. 
And gradually I will improve my English, despite being in Basic. 
Studying Information Systems and I am in the 6th period. 
And I'm still an intern. And yet I'm still on my way to becoming a Full-Stack

- ðŸ’¬ About me: 
I am fond of the area of computing and with a vast dream. 
Always studying and increasingly taking root in this branch that fascinates the world with new discoveries.
Information Systems and Technical Student Maintenance and Computer Support completed. 
However, I am looking for new experiences in computing and I am easy to learn and 
always open to new types of programming languages and the like.
